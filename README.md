# Basic Customer Feedback Portal

This project involves developing a basic customer feedback portal using HTML and JavaScript. This portal will allow users to submit feedback that includes their name, rating, and comments. This feedback will also be displayed on the same page.

## Tasks
-Create HTML file named `index.html`.
-Insert a `<form>` element inside `index.html` that includes a text input for a customer's name, a dropdown selection to choose a rating from 1 to 5, a textarea for comments, and a submit button.
-Create JavaScript file and name it `script.js`. Write this JavaScript to prevent the default form submision action to keep the page from reloading, validate that all fields are filled out and if any fields are left empty an alert is displayed. Append submitted feedback to display area upon successful form submission.
-Upon forms being submitted, create elements that will display customer name, rating, and any comments in the designated feedback display area.
